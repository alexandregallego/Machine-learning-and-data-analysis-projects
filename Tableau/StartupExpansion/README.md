# Clustering, joining different types of files, dashboards for different kinds of devices for deciding where a startup should invest on marketing

In this project I combined some of the amazing capablities that Tableau offers. The first one is the ability to join different types of files (in this case merging a csv file with an excel file). Another interesting feature that I discovered with this project is the ability to perform clustering without the need of any code, you just need to specify to Tableau the variables you want to take into account to perform the corresponding clustering (in this case: sum(marketing spend), popuulation and sum(revenue)). I also draw some trend lines, which also show their function (and you get to know how relevant is marketing for the revenue of those subsidiaries of the startup and therefore this will enable the company to decide where to invest on marketing for future expansion). Finally, I was also able to adapt the final dashboard to different type of devices (tablet, mobile or desktop).
