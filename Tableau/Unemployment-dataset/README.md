# Tableau to visualize unemployment data

With this project I made use of an area chart with Tableau to properly visualize how the unemployment dataset (defined in the excel file) was distributed. The results that can be observed make a lot of sense since the lower the age, the higher the unemployment. The data is filtered so it includes men and women.
