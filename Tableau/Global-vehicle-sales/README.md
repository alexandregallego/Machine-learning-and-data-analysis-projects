# Vehicle sales classified by region

Taking the excel file as source of data, I used Tableau to classify the vehicle sales per region. Firstly, I created a bar chart with percent of totals as labels. Once we could knew the percent of total sales per region and per year, I made use of a map to visualize it. I filtered the map by year as can be appreciated on the pdf.
