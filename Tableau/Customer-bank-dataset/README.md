# Building a storyline with Tableau based on the customer data of an UK located bank

Within this project I made us of the csv (comma separated values) file with the bankÂ´s customer data to build a storyline. First, I clasified the different customers based on the age (bar chart), balance (bar chart), gender (pie chart) and job classification (treemap). Once these classification was made I created some actions (select region, select job classification and select balance), so once one of these sections was selected on the storyline, the graph automatically updates.

This actions feature, allowed me to keep increasing the granularity of the visulalizations (going from the most general one - with all the customers data- to most specific ones - customer data of Scotland and England).
