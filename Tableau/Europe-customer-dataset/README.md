# Europe customer sales data

Within this project I had to classify the sales of different customers based on their location. First of all, I made use of Tableau mapping feature to show the regions that had the bigger amount of sales from the dataset. The larger the size of the circles, the bigger the amount of sales per regions. I also coloured the circles based on the margin of these sales.

The second sheet is a scatter customer plot where sales are plotted against the profit generated by them. The circles provide the following information:
- Name of the country
- Customer Name
- Name of the state
- Profit generated
- Amount of sales
- Profit Margin

These two sheets are combined in the final page in a dashboard, where you can select a state and then the customer scatter plot is automatically updated with the sales of the customers from that state. However, within the pdf version can not be appreciated.
