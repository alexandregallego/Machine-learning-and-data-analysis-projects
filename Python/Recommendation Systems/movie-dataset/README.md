# User to user collaborative filtering recommendation systems

Within this project I made use of the [MovieLensDataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/) to build a recommendation system based on the UserId.

This type of recommendation is what is called on collaborative filtering the User View. I strongly recommend to read this article, in order to understand how the algorithm works: [Collaborativefiltering](https://towardsdatascience.com/various-implementations-of-collaborative-filtering-100385c6dfe0)

In this project, I made use of 2 jupyter notebooks. The first one, includes not only a general approach on how to build a recommendation system on Python but also the ALS (Alternate Least Squares) approach. 
The second notebook, builds the recommendation system using PySpark.
