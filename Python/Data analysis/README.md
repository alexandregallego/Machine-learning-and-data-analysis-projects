# Climate data analysis

Within this project, I analyzed the different temperatures across the following period: 1701-2019. This analysis allowed me to see with real data, the relevance of climate change along the years.

In order to do it I made use of the dataset Berkeley Earth, which can be obtained on the following link: [Berkeley Earth dataset](http://berkeleyearth.org/)
