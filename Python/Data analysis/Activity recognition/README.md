# Pyphox recording of activity

The task with this project was to make use of pyphox application to record your physical activity and build multi-class classifiers to be able to differentiate among the activites, in my case: 30 seconds walking, 30 seconds running, 30 seconds jumping and 30 seconds walking again. I made use of different clasifiers such as: LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier and KNeighborsClassifier with different variables included.
